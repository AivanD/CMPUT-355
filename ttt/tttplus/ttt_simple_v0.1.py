# The board example.

# Done: 
#     - Environment is ready
#     - 1v1 mode
#
# To-Do:
#     - Implement solver
#         - Alpha-beta pruning (best case O(b^(d/2)))
#         - Minimax wo AlphaBeta
#     - Explanation for the solvers (algorithms)
#     - Update the UI accordingly -new solver-
#     - Add a terni-lapili game 
#         - Add a terni-lapilli solver -more research on that-
