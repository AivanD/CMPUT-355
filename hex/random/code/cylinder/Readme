* modified to work for r*t cylindrical hex board *
* e.g. 3*4 board, 3 rows, 4 columns
  usual adjacencies, except:
    * only sides are top and bottom
    * first cell in row j also adjacent to 
        - last cell in row j
        - last cell in row j+1
      so below: cell 00 touches cells 03 13
                cell 10 touches cells 13 23
                cell 20 touches cell 23
       00 01 02 03
        10 11 12 13
          20 21 22 23

BLACK owns top and bottom.
count BLACK wins as usual.
-------------------------------------------------------------

programs related to computing the nxn (n odd) prob that
1st player wins at Hex, assuming uni-random play

exact
  compute probs exactly by enumerating all possible k-subs,
  comp. feasible only if n = 3 or 5

approximate
  based on pseudo-random uni sampling

estwin.c 
  revised 
  * use guarded board
  * use recursion
oddprob.d 
  not yet revised
-------------
on 32 bit machine, max signed int is 2^31-1
