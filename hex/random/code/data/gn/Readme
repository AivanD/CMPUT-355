WARNING: I think these values are all garbage...
well, not quite... see below
I think they should be paired...


is there something wrong here?
e.g. for 3x3, win prob on move k should be

0 0 0 0 2/21  2/21  5/21  5/21  7/21=1/3

what are these other values?

HEY: I think I figured out what's wrong:

values should be paired....
