wrt reachable positions:   
a hex position is reachable iff number of black stones - number of white stones
is equal to 1 or 0, and
* either neither side has joined their sides, or* one side has joined their sides and there is a cut stone  who removal leaves the board with no winner

... it would be interesting to use random methods to
estimate these some day, so we can
more accurately talk about the size of the hex search dag...
